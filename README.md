Belly Button Analyis
[(The Truth is Out There)](https://john10roberts.github.io/plotly_deployment/)

 ## Overview of Project
Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

### Summary
We have completed Roza's dahboard.  We created a horizontal bar chart to identify the top 10 bacteria found in a subjects belly button.  Additionally, a bubble chart was created to show the bacteria type and the value of the bacteria present.  Lastly, a guage was added to show the subjects wash frequency in a given week.
